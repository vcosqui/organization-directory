**What can we store inside the modules/users folder?**

- DTOs
- Entities/Models
- Repositories (including our fake/mock implementations of them for TDD), services
- Providers that are specific to users (a hash provider that hashes the user password)
- Infra that is specific to users (we will see below what the infrastructure layer means).
